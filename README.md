# SPYClassification_AlgoTrading
Educational algorithmic trading program using machine learning to predict classification of SPY ETF price movement. (nonprofitable)

## Introduction
In this project I attempted to predict the classifaction of the price movement of the SPY ETF. A classifaction of 1 was assigned to increases in price and 0 was assigned to no change or decreases in price. There are two notebooks, and two datasets. One notebook and dataset is by 10 minute time periods and the other is by 1 minute time periods. 
-note: The 1 minute time period script is not trained and tested, but programming is completed.
